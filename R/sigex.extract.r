	#	Purpose: computes signal extraction estimates with two standard errors
	#	Background:
	#		A sigex model consists of process x = sum y, for
	#		stochastic components y.  Each component process y_t
	#		is either stationary or is reduced to stationarity by
	#		application of a differencing polynomial delta(B), i.e.
	#			w_t = delta(B) y_t   is stationary.
	#		We have a model for each w_t process, and can compute its
	#		autocovariance function (acf), and denote its autocovariance
	#		generating function (acgf) via gamma_w (B).
	#		The signal extraction filter for y_t is determined from
	#		this acgf and delta.
	#		param is the name for the model parameters entered into
	#		a list object with a more intuitive structure, whereas
	#		psi refers to a vector of real numbers containing all
	#		hyper-parameters (i.e., reals mapped bijectively to the parameter	manifold)
	#	Inputs:
	#		data.ts: a T x N matrix ts object
	#		my.filter: list object corresponding to the output of sigex.signal,
	#			a list object of f.mat and v.mat.
	#			f.mat: array of dimension c(T,N,T,N), where f.mat[,j,,k]
	#				is the signal extraction matrix that utilizes input series k
	#				to generate the signal estimate for series j.
	#			v.mat: array of dimension c(T,N,T,N), where v.mat[,j,,k]
	#				is the error covariance matrix arising from input series k
	#				used to generate the signal estimate for series j.
	#		mdl: the specified sigex model, a list object
	#		param: see background.  Must have form specified by mdl
	#	Outputs:
	#		list object with extract, upp, and low
	#		extract: T x N matrix of the signal estimates
	#		upp: as extract, plus twice the standard error
	#		low: as extract, minus twice the standard error
