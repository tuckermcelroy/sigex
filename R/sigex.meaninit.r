#' Adds trend regressors to an existing model
#'
#' Background:
#'		x is a multivariate time series (N x T), and each individual series
#'		can have its distinct set of regressors.  So for each 1 <= j <= N,
#'		x[j,] is length T and has r_j number of length T regressors.
#'		There is a default regressor of polynomial time: suppose the
#'		time series has d unit roots (d >= 0), and this applies to each
#'		individual series (differencing polynomials are the same for all
#'		individual series in sigex).  Then the regressor t^d for 1 <= t <= T
#'		is the default "mean effect".  (Coefficients of lower order time
#'		polynomial effects cannot be identified.)  When d=0, this is
#'		just the mean of the process.  (Although it need not be stationary
#'		when d=0, any other non-stationary latent components are assumed to
#'		have mean zero for identifiability.)  One can always add higher order
#'		time polynomial regressors, if desired.
#'
#'	Notes: always use this function when setting up the model.
#'		First make all calls to sigex.add, then call sigex.meaninit,
#'		and then add additional regressors (if needed) with sigex.reg.
#'
#' @param mdl  The specified sigex model, a list object.
#'			mdl[[1]] is mdlK, gives ranks of white noise covariance matrix
#'			mdl[[2]] is mdlType, a list giving t.s. model class, order, and bounds
#'			mdl[[3]] is mdlDiff, gives delta differencing polynomials
#'		  mdl[[4]] is list of regressors by individual series
#' @param data.ts   A T x N matrix ts object
#' @param	d  Order of time polynomial trend regressor desired, labeled as "Trend".
#'  		However, if a trend component exists in the model,
#'			then this d is ignored, and the number of unit roots
#'			is instead used to determine d.
