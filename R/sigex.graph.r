#' Adds signal extraction estimates, with shaded bands,

#'
#'		Background:
#'		A sigex model consists of process x = sum y, for
#'		stochastic components y.  Each component process y_t
#'		is either stationary or is reduced to stationarity by
#'		application of a differencing polynomial delta(B), i.e.
#'			w_t = delta(B) y_t   is stationary.
#'		We have a model for each w_t process, and can compute its
#'		autocovariance function (acf), and denote its autocovariance
#'		generating function (acgf) via gamma_w (B).
#'		The signal extraction filter for y_t is determined from
#'		this acgf and delta.

#' @param extract T x N matrix of the signal estimates, e.g. output of sigex.extract
#' @param	reg A T x N matrix of fixed effects, to be added to extraction.

	#	Purpose: adds signal extraction estimates, with shaded bands,
	#		to an existing time series plot
	#	Background:
	#		A sigex model consists of process x = sum y, for
	#		stochastic components y.  Each component process y_t
	#		is either stationary or is reduced to stationarity by
	#		application of a differencing polynomial delta(B), i.e.
	#			w_t = delta(B) y_t   is stationary.
	#		We have a model for each w_t process, and can compute its
	#		autocovariance function (acf), and denote its autocovariance
	#		generating function (acgf) via gamma_w (B).
	#		The signal extraction filter for y_t is determined from
	#		this acgf and delta.
	#	Inputs:
	#		extract: T x N matrix of the signal estimates, e.g. output of sigex.extract
	#		reg: a T x N matrix of fixed effects, to be added to extraction.
	#			Note: only the column of reg corresponding to "series" is utilized.
	#			(To incorporate multiple reg effects, add these all up before hand.)
	#		start.date: date of first time obersvation; the
	#			 format is c(year,season)
	#		period: number of seasons per year
	#		series: index of the particular series under consideration
	#		displace: gives a vertical shift to the plot
	#		color: given as a number in the range of colors()
	#		fade: gives shading proportion for uncertainty (NULL if none)
	#	Outputs: none
