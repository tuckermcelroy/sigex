	#	Purpose: computes model-based signal extraction diagnostics
	#	Background:
	#		A sigex model consists of process x = sum y, for
	#		stochastic components y.  Each component process y_t
	#		is either stationary or is reduced to stationarity by
	#		application of a differencing polynomial delta(B), i.e.
	#			w_t = delta(B) y_t   is stationary.
	#		We have a model for each w_t process, and can compute its
	#		autocovariance function (acf), and denote its autocovariance
	#		generating function (acgf) via gamma_w (B).
	#		The signal extraction filter for y_t is determined from
	#		this acgf and delta.
	#		Signal extraction diagnostics are computed, which are based
	#		on autocorrelations of differenced estimated signals, compared
	#		to their expected variability.  Blakely and McElroy (2017 Econometric Reviews)
	#		discusses the theory in generality; this version does
	#		not take parameter uncertainty into account.
	#		param is the name for the model parameters entered into
	#		a list object with a more intuitive structure, whereas
	#		psi refers to a vector of real numbers containing all
	#		hyper-parameters (i.e., reals mapped bijectively to the parameter	manifold)
	#	Inputs:
	#		signal: a T x N matrix ts object of the extracted signal
	#		param: see background.  Must have form specified by mdl
	#		mdl: the specified sigex model, a list object
	#		sigcomps: indices of the latent components composing the signal
	#		lagall: each signal diagnostic has a lag argument.  They are all
	#			computed, from lags one through lagall
	#	Outputs:
	#		diagnostics: complex matrix with lagall rows and N columns, one
	#			column for each series.  The real part is the diagnostic
	#			value, given by sample autocorrelation at various lags of
	#			the estimated signal.  The imaginary part is the t statistic
	#			of the diagnostic: statistic minus null mean, divided by
	#			standard error.
	#	Requires: sigex.delta, sigex.acf
