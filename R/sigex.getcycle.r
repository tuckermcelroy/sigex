#' Compute AR and MA polynomials for Butterworth and Balanced cycles
#'
#' Background:
#'		A stochastic cycle is a particular parametrization of an ARMA process,
#'		governed by its order, its persistency (rho), and its period (2/omega)
#'
#' @param cycle.order Integer order of the cycle
#' @param rho Persistency, a value between 0 and 1
#' @param	omega Frequency in units of pi, a value between 0 and 1.
#'			(The period is 2/omega)
#'
#' @return list object with cycle.AR and cycle.MA
#'		cycle.AR: full AR polynomial in format c(1,-phi1,...,-phip)
#'		cycle.MA: full MA polynomial in format c(1,theta1,...,thetaq)

	#	Purpose: compute AR and MA polynomials for Butterworth and Balanced cycles
	#	Background:
	#		A stochastic cycle is a particular parametrization of an ARMA process,
	#		governed by its order, its persistency (rho), and its period (2/omega)
	#	Inputs:
	#		cycle.order: integer order of the cycle
	#		rho: persistency, a value between 0 and 1
	#		omega: frequency in units of pi, a value between 0 and 1.
	#			(The period is 2/omega)
	#	Outputs:
	#		list object with cycle.AR and cycle.MA
	#		cycle.AR: full AR polynomial in format c(1,-phi1,...,-phip)
	#		cycle.MA: full MA polynomial in format c(1,theta1,...,thetaq)
	#	Requires: polymult
