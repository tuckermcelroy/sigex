#' Compute differencing polynomial with factors omitted
#'
#' Background:
#'		A sigex model consists of process x = sum y, for
#'		stochastic components y.  Each component process y_t
#'		is either stationary or is reduced to stationarity by
#'		application of a differencing polynomial delta(B), i.e.
#'			w_t = delta(B) y_t   is stationary.
#'		The differencing polynomial for x_t is the product of
#'		the components' polynomials, so long as they are relatively prime
#'		(this is assumed).  Applying this product polynomial to x_t,
#'		the effect on a summand y_t is that it is differenced to
#'		stationary w_t, but a remainder polynomial acts on w_t as well,
#'		given by the product of all other polynomials.
#'
#' @param mdl The specified sigex model, a list object
#' @param omits Indices of components that are to be omitted,
#'			when computing the product of differencing polynomials
#'			for the various components.
#'
#' @return Updated differencing polynomial,
#'		written in format c(delta0,delta1,...,deltad)
#' @export

	#	Purpose: compute differencing polynomial with factors omitted
	#	Background:
	#		A sigex model consists of process x = sum y, for

	#	Inputs:
	#		mdl: the specified sigex model, a list object.
 	#		omits: indices of components that are to be omitted,
	#			when computing the product of differencing polynomials
	#			for the various components.
	#	Outputs:
	#		updated differencing polynomial,
	#		written in format c(delta0,delta1,...,deltad)
