	#	Purpose: determine a reduced rank model from a given fitted model
	#	Background:
	#		A sigex model consists of process x = sum y, for
	#		stochastic components y.  Each component process y_t
	#		is either stationary or is reduced to stationarity by
	#		application of a differencing polynomial delta(B), i.e.
	#			w_t = delta(B) y_t   is stationary.
	#		We have a model for each w_t process, which is specified
	#		through the ranks (indices of non-zero Schur complements,
	#		cf. background for sigex.param2gcd) of the white noise
	#		covariance matrix; also there is the model type, which
	#		denotes the specification of the t.s. model for w_t;
	#		all the regressors, which are specified by individual time series
	#		rather than by latent component, and must have length T;
	#		pre-specified bounds for cyclical parameters, for each component,
	#		if applicable.
	#		param is the name for the model parameters entered into
	#		a list object with a more intuitive structure, whereas
	#		psi refers to a vector of real numbers containing all
	#		hyper-parameters (i.e., reals mapped bijectively to the parameter	manifold)
	#	Inputs:
	#		data.ts: a T x N matrix ts object
	#		param: see background
	#		mdl: the specified sigex model, a list object.  This is whatever
	#			model you have so far specified, to which you will be adding
	#			model structure corresponding to the new component.  If this
	#			is your first component, then set mdl <- NULL
	#			mdl[[1]] is mdlK, gives ranks of white noise covariance matrix
	#			mdl[[2]] is mdlType, a list giving t.s. model class, order, and bounds
	#			mdl[[3]] is mdlDiff, gives delta differencing polynomials
	#		      mdl[[4]] is list of regressors by individual series
	#		thresh: lower bound on Schur complements
	#		modelFlag: when TRUE, small Schur complements imply rank reduction
	#			in the new model.  When modelFlag is FALSE, small Schur
	#			complements are replaced by exp(thresh)
	#	Outputs:
	#		mdl.red: the new sigex model, a list object
	#		par.red: the new param for the new model
	#	Requires: sigex.par2psi, sigex.conditions, sigex.add,
	#		sigex.meaninit, sigex.renderpd
