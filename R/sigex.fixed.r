#' Computes all nontrend fixed regression effects
#'
#' Background:
#'		x is a multivariate time series (N x T), and each individual series
#'		can have its distinct set of regressors.  So for each 1 <= j <= N,
#'		x[j,] is length T and has r_j number of length T regressors.
#'		There is a default regressor of polynomial time: suppose the
#'		time series has d unit roots (d >= 0), and this applies to each
#'		individual series (differencing polynomials are the same for all
#'		individual series in sigex).  Then the regressor t^d for 1 <= t <= T
#'		is the default "mean effect".  (Coefficients of lower order time
#'		polynomial effects cannot be identified.)  When d=0, this is
#'		just the mean of the process.  (Although it need not be stationary
#'		when d=0, any other non-stationary latent components are assumed to
#'		have mean zero for identifiability.)  One can always add higher order
#'		time polynomial regressors, if desired.
#'		param is the name for the model parameters entered into
#'		a list object with a more intuitive structure, whereas
#'		psi refers to a vector of real numbers containing all
#'		hyper-parameters (i.e., reals mapped bijectively to the parameter	manifold)
#'
#' @param data.ts A T x N matrix ts object
#' @param	mdl The specified sigex model, a list object
#' @param	series Integer between 1 and N, the index of the individual series for
#'			which regression effects are being computed.
#' @param	param The model parameters entered into a list object
#' @param	type A string designating the name of the regression effect
#'
#' @return 	mean.mat: length T time series consisting of regression effects.
#'			This has the format X %*% beta, where each column of
#'			X is a regressor of "type", and beta consists of the corresponding
#'			regression parameters.

	#	Purpose: computes all nontrend fixed regression effects
	#	Background:
	#		x is a multivariate time series (N x T), and each individual series
	#		can have its distinct set of regressors.  So for each 1 <= j <= N,
	#		x[j,] is length T and has r_j number of length T regressors.
	#		There is a default regressor of polynomial time: suppose the

	#		individual series (differencing polynomials are the same for all
	#		individual series in sigex).  Then the regressor t^d for 1 <= t <= T
	#		is the default "mean effect".  (Coefficients of lower order time

	#		param is the name for the model parameters entered into
	#		a list object with a more intuitive structure, whereas
	#		psi refers to a vector of real numbers containing all
	#		hyper-parameters (i.e., reals mapped bijectively to the parameter	manifold)
	#	Inputs:
	#		data.ts: a T x N matrix ts object
	#		mdl: the specified sigex model, a list object.
 	#		series: integer between 1 and N, the index of the individual series for
	#			which regression effects are being computed.
	#		param: see background.  Must have form specified by mdl
	#		type: a string designating the name of the regression effect
	#	Outputs:
	#		mean.mat: length T time series consisting of regression effects.
	#			This has the format X %*% beta, where each column of
