	#	Purpose: build the model by adding on another latent component
	#	Background:
	#		A sigex model consists of process x = sum y, for
	#		stochastic components y.  Each component process y_t
	#		is either stationary or is reduced to stationarity by
	#		application of a differencing polynomial delta(B), i.e.
	#			w_t = delta(B) y_t   is stationary.
	#		We have a model for each w_t process, which is specified
	#		through the ranks (indices of non-zero Schur complements,
	#		cf. background for sigex.param2gcd) of the white noise
	#		covariance matrix; also there is the model type, which
	#		denotes the specification of the t.s. model for w_t;
	#		all the regressors, which are specified by individual time series
	#		rather than by latent component, and must have length T;
	#		pre-specified bounds for cyclical parameters, for each component,
	#		if applicable.
	#	Inputs:
	#		mdl: the specified sigex model, a list object.  This is whatever
	#			model you have so far specified, to which you will be adding
	#			model structure corresponding to the new component.  If this
	#			is your first component, then set mdl <- NULL
	#			mdl[[1]] is mdlK, gives ranks of white noise covariance matrix
	#			mdl[[2]] is mdlType, a list giving t.s. model class, order, and bounds
	#			mdl[[3]] is mdlDiff, gives delta differencing polynomials
	#		      mdl[[4]] is list of regressors by individual series
	#		vrank: vector of integers between 1 and N, corresponding
	#			to indices of non-zero Schur complements in the GCD
	#			of the innovations' covariance matrix for the new latent component
	#		class: character string of t.s. model type for the new latent component
	#		order: vector of model order
	#	      bounds: four numbers, gives bounds for rho and omega,
	#			the cycle parameters of the new latent component
	#			rho lies in (bounds[1],bounds[2])
	#			omega lies in (bounds[3],bounds[4])
	#		name: character string giving the latent component's name
	#		delta: differencing polynomial (corresponds to delta(B) in Background)
	#			written in format c(delta0,delta1,...,deltad)
	#	Outputs:
	#		mdl: the updated sigex model, a list object
