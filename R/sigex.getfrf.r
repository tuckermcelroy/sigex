#' Computes frequency response function for desired signal and plots it
#'
#' Background:
#'		A sigex model consists of process x = sum y, for
#'		stochastic components y.  Each component process y_t
#'		is either stationary or is reduced to stationarity by
#'		application of a differencing polynomial delta(B), i.e.
#'			w_t = delta(B) y_t   is stationary.
#'		We have a model for each w_t process, and can compute its
#'		autocovariance function (acf), and denote its autocovariance
#'		generating function (acgf) via gamma_w (B).
#'		The signal extraction filter for y_t is determined from
#'		this acgf and delta.
#'		param is the name for the model parameters entered into
#'		a list object with a more intuitive structure, whereas
#'		psi refers to a vector of real numbers containing all
#'		hyper-parameters (i.e., reals mapped bijectively to the parameter	manifold)
#'
#'	Notes: take grid >> len, else numerical issues arise

#' @param data.ts A T x N matrix ts object
#' @param	param The model parameters entered into a list object

	#	Inputs:
	#		data.ts: a T x N matrix ts object
	#		param: see background.  Must have form specified by mdl
	#		mdl: the specified sigex model, a list object
