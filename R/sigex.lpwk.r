#' Computes signal extraction filter coefficients

#'		(specified by trendcyclecomp) with LP filter of cutoff.
#'
#'		Background:
#'		A sigex model consists of process x = sum y, for
#'		stochastic components y.  Each component process y_t
#'		is either stationary or is reduced to stationarity by
#'		application of a differencing polynomial delta(B), i.e.
#'			w_t = delta(B) y_t   is stationary.
#'		We have a model for each w_t process, and can compute its
#'		autocovariance function (acf), and denote its autocovariance
#'		generating function (acgf) via gamma_w (B).
#'		The signal extraction filter for y_t is determined from
#'		this acgf and delta.
#'		param is the name for the model parameters entered into
#'		a list object with a more intuitive structure, whereas
#'		psi refers to a vector of real numbers containing all
#'		hyper-parameters (i.e., reals mapped bijectively to the parameter	manifold)
#'
#'	Notes: take grid >> len, else numerical issues arise
#'
#' @param data.ts A T x N matrix ts object
#' @param param  model parameters entered into
#'		a list object with an intuitive structure.
#' @param	mdl The specified sigex model, a list object
#' @param	trendcyclecomp  The (single) index of the trend-cycle component
#' @param	sigcomps Provides indices of a desired component that

#' @param grid Desired number of frequencies for spectrum calculations

	#	Purpose: computes signal extraction filter coefficients
	#		for trend and cycle, by combining WK filter for trend-cycle
	#		(specified by trendcyclecomp) with LP filter of cutoff.
	#	Background:
	#		A sigex model consists of process x = sum y, for
	#		stochastic components y.  Each component process y_t
	#		is either stationary or is reduced to stationarity by
	#		application of a differencing polynomial delta(B), i.e.
	#			w_t = delta(B) y_t   is stationary.
	#		We have a model for each w_t process, and can compute its
	#		autocovariance function (acf), and denote its autocovariance
	#		generating function (acgf) via gamma_w (B).
	#		The signal extraction filter for y_t is determined from
	#		this acgf and delta.
	#		param is the name for the model parameters entered into
	#		a list object with a more intuitive structure, whereas
	#		psi refers to a vector of real numbers containing all
	#		hyper-parameters (i.e., reals mapped bijectively to the parameter	manifold)
	#	Notes: take grid >> len, else numerical issues arise
	#	Inputs:
	#		data.ts: a T x N matrix ts object
	#		param: see background.  Must have form specified by mdl
	#		mdl: the specified sigex model, a list object
	#		trendcyclecomp: is the (single) index of the trend-cycle component
	#		sigcomps: provides indices of a desired component that
	#			is disjoint from trend-cycle, so that MSEs of
	#			trend+sigcomps and cycle+sigcomps are computed.
	#		 	(Pass in sigcomps = NULL to just get trend and cycle MSEs.)
	#		grid: desired number of frequencies for spectrum calculations
	#		len: max index of the filter coefficients
	#		cutoff: is a number between 0 and pi, with all frequencies < cutoff preserved
	#		trunc: truncation index for LP filter
	#	Outputs:
	#		list object with psi.lpwk and psi.ilpwk
	#		psi.lpwk: array of dimension c(N,N,2*trunc+1), filter coefficients for trend
	#		psi.ilpwk: array of dimension c(N,N,2*trunc+1), filter coefficients for cycle
