#' Embeds a given high frequency filter as a low frequency filter

#'     Background:	a scalar high frequency filter acts on a high frequency time series
#'     by convolution.  If we embed as a low frequency time series, the
#'     corresponding filter is now a matrix filter.

#' @param filter.hi Given scalar high frequency filter of length L
#' @param hi.freq  Sampling frequency of high frequency time series
#' @param low.freq Sampling frequency of low frequency time series
#' @param shift.hi  The integer offset for the high frequency filter:

#'     set shift.hi = 0 for a causal filter
#'
#' @return filter.low: array s x s x M,

  #	Purpose: embeds a given high frequency filter as a low frequency filter
  #     for a vector embedding
  #	Background:	a scalar high frequency filter acts on a high frequency time series
  #     by convolution.  If we embed as a low frequency time series, the
  #     corresponding filter is now a matrix filter.
  #	Inputs:
  #  filter.hi is given scalar high frequency filter of length L
  #  hi.freq is sampling frequency of high frequency time series
  #  low.freq is sampling frequency of low frequency time series
  #  shift.hi gives the integer offset for the high frequency filter:
  #     filter coefficients have indices -shift.hi,...,0,...,L-1-shift.hi
  #     set shift.hi = 0 for a causal filter
  #	outputs:
  #   filter.low is array s x s x M,
  #     where s = hi.freq/low.freq (must be an integer)
  #     and M is length, which depends on s, L, and shift.hi
  #   shift.low is integer offset for the low frequency filter
