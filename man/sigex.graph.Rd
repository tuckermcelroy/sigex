\title{Adds signal extraction estimates, with shaded bands,
	to an existing time series plot}
\usage{
sigex.graph(
  extract,
  reg = NULL,
  start.date,
  period,
  series,
  displace,
  color,
  fade
)
}
\arguments{
\item{extract}{T x N matrix of the signal estimates, e.g. output of sigex.extract}

\item{reg}{A T x N matrix of fixed effects, to be added to extraction.
Note: only the column of reg corresponding to "series" is utilized.
(To incorporate multiple reg effects, add these all up before hand.)}

\item{start.date}{Date of first time obersvation; the
format is c(year,season)}

\item{period}{Number of seasons per year}

\item{series}{Index of the particular series under consideration}

\item{displace}{Gives a vertical shift to the plot}

\item{color}{Given as a number in the range of colors()}

\item{fade}{Gives shading proportion for uncertainty (NULL if none)}
}
\value{
NA
}
\description{
Background:
	A sigex model consists of process x = sum y, for
	stochastic components y.  Each component process y_t
	is either stationary or is reduced to stationarity by
	application of a differencing polynomial delta(B), i.e.
		w_t = delta(B) y_t   is stationary.
	We have a model for each w_t process, and can compute its
	autocovariance function (acf), and denote its autocovariance
	generating function (acgf) via gamma_w (B).
	The signal extraction filter for y_t is determined from
	this acgf and delta.
