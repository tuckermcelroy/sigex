* launch.R - defines all parameters and sources run.R
* run.R - takes params from launch.R, sets up mdl and sigex data, envokes
          sigex.mlefit(), saves entire image
* results.Rdata - whole image of model directory run
* diagnostics.R - starts with load(results.RData) and looks at diagnostics
* regressors.R - contains all regressors


Model Dictionary
----------------
A. Initial model. No regressors
A2. Repeat model A w/ increased maxiter in optim
A3. increased maxiter and order (2, 2)(0, 1)
A4. increased maxiter and order (3, 2)(0, 1)
A5. increased maxiter and order (2, 2)(1, 0)
A6. increased maxiter and order (4, 0)(0, 1)
B. All holiday regressors included
C. Only include significant regressors (NewYears, MLK, and Labor Day)
D. look at ACF and PACF of differenced series and pick SMA(1, 1) model
E. choose model based on the results of auto.arima()
   this requires the data to be twice first differenced
F. Fix seasonal theta to be -0.8
